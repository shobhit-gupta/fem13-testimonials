			I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more
			so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

			“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
			transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
			for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
			The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
			the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
			startup. ”

<!-- Verified Graduate -->

<!-- The team was very supportive and kept me motivated -->

<!-- “ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer  -->
<!-- for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ” -->

<!-- Jeanette Harmon -->
<!-- Verified Graduate -->

<!-- An overall wonderful and rewarding experience -->

<!-- “ Thank you for the wonderful experience! I now have a job I really enjoy, and make a good living  -->
<!-- while doing something I love. ” -->

<!-- Patrick Abrams -->
<!-- Verified Graduate -->

<!-- Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and  -->
<!-- learning from their experiences was easy. -->

<!-- “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program  -->
<!-- gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable  -->
<!-- junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from  -->
<!-- an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ” -->

<!-- Kira Whittle -->
<!-- Verified Graduate -->

<!-- Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended! -->

<!-- “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from  -->
<!-- professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former  -->
<!-- student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff  -->
<!-- did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team  -->
<!-- project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial  -->
<!-- could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent  -->
<!-- experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.  -->
<!-- 100% recommend! ” -->
